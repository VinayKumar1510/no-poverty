                        The global poverty situation is complex and multifaceted, influenced by a variety of economic, social, and political factors. Here's an overview of the current state of global poverty:

                        <li className='font-semibold'>1. Extreme Poverty:</li>

                        <li> As of recent estimates, around 9.2% of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, which is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. This figure has declined significantly from 36% in 1990.</li>

                        <li className='font-semibold'>2.Global Inequality:</li>

                        <li> Despite progress, significant disparities exist between regions. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the highest rates of extreme poverty.</li>

                        <li className='font-semibold'>3. Impact of COVID-19:</li>

                        <li>The pandemic has reversed some of the progress made in poverty reduction. The World Bank estimates that the pandemic pushed an additional 97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020.

                    <p className='mt-[60px]'>Poverty is driven by a complex interplay of economic, social, political, and environmental factors. Economically, unemployment, underemployment, and limited access to markets hinder individuals from earning sufficient income, while economic instability and high debt levels exacerbate financial vulnerability. Social factors, such as inadequate access to quality education and healthcare, discrimination, and family dynamics, further entrench poverty by limiting opportunities for advancement. Politically, poor governance, corruption, and ongoing conflicts disrupt societal stability and divert resources away from development initiatives. Environmentally, natural disasters and the adverse effects of climate change can devastate communities, particularly those dependent on agriculture, leading to loss of livelihoods and increased poverty. These factors often reinforce each other, creating a persistent cycle of poverty that requires multifaceted and sustainable interventions to address effectively .</p>
